# Kibo-II

Welcome to the Magic Forest!
The aim of this project is to get a positive mark on programming class :). 
We hope that we will succeed. We have to admit that we had lots of fun doing that game. 
However, there is still a lot of work to do.

## What's done:
* creating the menu
* creating the world
* creating platforms
* creating the player (Red Riding Hood) and his basic functions: walking, jumping
* creating the enemy - wolf
* creating the victim - pigeon
* creating the goal - blueberry bush
* creating music and sounds (footsteps, jumping, wolf howl)
* creating graphics for everything

## To do:
* fix jumping on platforms, because the player stops in the middle of the platforms
* figure out how to catch and drop the blueberry
* figure out how to throw the blueberry at the wolf and save our pigeon
* maybe add next levels or extend existing one

## What we used:
* pygame - Python library for writing video games
